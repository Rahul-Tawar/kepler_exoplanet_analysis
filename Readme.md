# Data Analytics and Preprocessing - Kepler Exoplanet Dataset

This project is part of our college presentation on **"Data Analytics and Preprocessing"**, where we explore and process the **Kepler Exoplanet Dataset** to gain insights into exoplanets ‚Äî planets outside our solar system.

---

## üìä Objective

Our aim is to demonstrate how real-world datasets are preprocessed for analysis and modeling. We used the Kepler dataset as it represents authentic scientific data and challenges like missing values, domain-specific jargon, and noisy entries.

---

## üåå About the Dataset

The **Kepler Mission** by NASA was designed to find Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. The dataset includes information about thousands of stars and planetary candidates discovered by the Kepler telescope.

We have **renamed the original columns** to make them more descriptive. Below is a table explaining each column in plain English.
